L'Aquila Earthquake Analysis
Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides an analysis of the L'Aquila earthquake that occurred on April 6, 2009, in central Italy. The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.3, was one of the deadliest in the country in the last 30 years, claiming over 300 lives and leaving thousands homeless.

However, the earthquake is also known for the controversy surrounding it. Six scientists and one government official from the Italian National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Major Risks were accused of downplaying the risk of a major earthquake just six days before the mainshock. They were convicted of manslaughter, although this conviction was later overturned on appeal.
